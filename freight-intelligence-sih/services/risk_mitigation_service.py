"""
Pillar (d): Risk Monitor - a combined ACTION from both models, not a severity badge.

WHAT CHANGED AND WHY
    The previous version returned a Low/Medium/High tier computed from congestion and
    weather alone. Model 2 was not consulted at all, so the panel could say "risk: low"
    while the forecast was screaming that rates were about to move.

    A charterer's real question is not "how busy is the port" but "should I commit a
    vessel, and when". That needs both models:

        Model 2  -> is the market about to move against me?
        Model 1  -> if I commit a vessel, where does it sit, and for how long?
        Weather  -> can the berth actually work tomorrow?

    So this now emits an ACTION with its reasoning, not a severity:

        CHARTER NOW   rates rising AND port congested - the worst combination, both
                      the price and the berth are turning against you
        LOCK IN       rates rising, port clear - take the rate before the market moves
        HOLD          no urgency either way
        WAIT          rates falling - stay spot and let them come to you
        AVOID ADDING  an explicit flag when committing more tonnage is the wrong move

    Every reason cites which model produced it and how confident that model is. If a
    model is missing the output degrades to what can be said, and says what is missing.
